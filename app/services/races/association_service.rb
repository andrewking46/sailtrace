module Races
  # AssociationService is responsible for deciding whether a Recording
  # belongs to an existing Race or if we should create a new Race.
  #
  # The "ultimate" approach below:
  # 1. Filters potential races by time and distance.
  # 2. Prefers the Race with the closest start coordinate to the Recording.
  # 3. Fallbacks to creating a new Race if none match.
  #
  # This logic aims to:
  # - Minimize false negatives by catching all Races within our thresholds.
  # - Minimize false positives by carefully picking the closest Race.
  # - Remain simple and memory-efficient by leveraging standard ActiveRecord
  #   queries and geospatial indexing from Geocoder.
